# Blog App (Hacker Rank)

## Live App: 
https://xylexa-blog-app.vercel.app/

## Description
This is a demonstration project to showcase route protection and route manipulation using login functionality. The login feature is just a placeholder to switch to protected routes and is not fully implemented for production use.

Additionally, this project loads blog data from the Hacker News API and utilizes an infinite scrolling technique to display how an API can be integrated with the frontend in React. The infinite scrolling allows the user to seamlessly load more content as they scroll down, simulating real-time data fetching in a dynamic web application.

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Login (For Protected Routes)
